1. Not able to generate all possible assignments at one time (extremely high memory required)
2. Takes too long to loop all possible assignments
3. Fluctuating price

5. Distance from vessel to vessel ... (possible to integrate osm?), currently assume only two locations

7. distributed system

1. process showing the for loops, standard block shapes
2. refuel time at oil terminal as a separate line
3. check if the best is best (check the codes)
4. features to be presented to machine learning why its not a good assignment
mayyyyyybe for example, the barge and vessel initial details 10 vessels and 4 barge look together
however only applies to 10 and 4, need to find features independent on size
5. spread the time to a week and extend transfer time
