(1) Vessels stay for about 2-3 days (i.e. vessels are available for 2-3 days)
 
(2) Bunker transfer from barge to vessel takes about 5, 10 or 12 hrs (if 10 hrs, amount of bunker transferred is 4,000 metric tons, so that gives the rate of transfer which can be similarly applied to the case of 5 hrs or 12 hrs).

10*60/4000=0.15 min/metric tons
-> 5    2000
-> 10   4000
-> 12   4800

(3) Bunker transfer from oil terminal to barge takes about 20 hrs (for 20 hrs, amount transferred is 40,000 metric tons, so that gives the rate of transfer which is faster because the pump at oil terminal is more powerful).
 
maximum barge capacity: 40000 metric tons
top up rate:            0.03 min/ton

(4) 6 types of bunker, but 5 separate tanks in barge (but to keep things simple, maybe just assume only one type of bunker to be used for all vessels).

assume 1 type of bunker---> not assumed
 
(5) Barge takes 2-3 hrs to travel from one vessel to another, and also takes 2-3 hrs to travel between oil terminal and vessel.
